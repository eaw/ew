1. WHAT IS THLNK.VIM
====================
Thlnk.vim enables URL based hyperlinking for plain text.

- Thlnk stands for "plain text hyperlinking".
- Thlnk.vim is a plugin for the Vim text editor (see http://www.vim.org)
- It brings the benefits of URL-based hyperlinking to the realm of plain text.
- It is the implementation of a general approach for better and more
  powerful text editing and browsing. Its about text culture.
  That's why Thlnk also is a project.

It requires the Vim text editor as a prerequisite und runs where Vim runs.

Thlnk.vim is free software. See section LICENCE below.

For installation see section INSTALLATION below.

Thlnk.vim homepage: //www.bf-consulting.de/thlnk/vim


2. INSTALLATION
===============

2.1 Prerequisites
-----------------
For basic usage you just need the Vim editor, Version 6 (tested with 6.0, 6.1)

OPTIONAL:
  For internet usage the wget tool is recommended:
  ∞ It's really optional: ThlnkVim runs anyway, http/ftp hyperlinks just
    will not work at runtime
  ∞ GNU Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the Internet
    using HTTP and FTP, the two most widely used Internet protocols.
    It works non-interactively.
  ∞ It is available from http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html


2.2. Installation Instructions
------------------------------

1.  copy the thlnk-xxx.zip file to your 
    $HOME/.vim  (unix) 
    or 
    $HOME\vimfiles  (windows) 
    directory 

    (if something doesn't work or if you would like some explanations, 
     see :help add-global-plugin) 

2.  unzip thlnk-xxx.zip at that location. This should create the files: 

    thlnk_README.txt (this file)
    plugin/ 
	    thlnk.vim 
	    thlnkarr.vim 
	    thlnkscm.vim 
	    thlnkuri.vim 
    doc/ 
	    thlnkref.txt 
	    thlnkusr.txt 

3.  Restart vim and execute 

    :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc (unix) 
    or 
    :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc (windows) 

    (this step should rebuild the tags file in the doc/ directory. 
     If something doesn't work or if you would like some explanations, 
     see ":help add-local-help") 

4.  Type: 
	:help thlnk 
    to get started and run some live examples

    - Enhanced documentation: new sections "Tips and Common Pitfails",
      "mapping and commands" ...

    - Bug fix. Reported by "Patrik Nyman" <patrik.nyman@orient.su.se>.

    Is a plugin for Vim6 now:
